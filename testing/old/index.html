	<p style="text-align:center">Page last updated on 11th February 2021</p>
	
	<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
	
	<p>This website houses software tools for assessing anthelmintic efficacy based on faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) in animals and egg reduction rates (ERR) in humans. To read more about the statistical theory and methods that underpin these tools read the background given further down this page. To jump straight to the online calculators use the links below:</p>

	<p>Please note that the page is currently in development and more background and external links will be added soon. In the meantime, any <a href="about">questions and feedback</a> are extremely welcome!</p>

	<h2>STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK</h2>
	
	<p>The core principle that underpins the work shown here is that FECRT can be regarded as two separate hypothesis tests:  a one-sided non-inferioirty test of susceptibility, and a one-sided inferiority test for resistance. For the complete background see "A hypothesis testing framework for the ratio of means of two negative binomial distributions: classifying the efficacy of anthelmintic treatment against intestinal parasites": a pre-peer-reviewed version of the article is available to download from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06667">the arXiv database</a> (see the REFERENCES section below for citation instructions).</p>
		
	<h2>DATA ANALYSIS</h2>

	<p>The ultimate goal of a FECRT or ERR is to be able to classify the efficacy as reflecting a population of parasites that are either susceptible or resistant to the anthelmintic compound administered. In order to do this, it is first necessary to determine two quantities: (1) the expected efficay of the anthelmintic and (2) the lower efficacy threshold. The expected efficacy should be based on the first reported efficacy values for the drug in presumed naive populations of parasites, and can typically be used from the literature. The lower efficacy threshold is based on the non-inferiority margin selected for the test of susceptibility, which reflects the lowest efficacy that is considered to be "close enough" to the expected efficacy to eliminate practical concerns about resistance. As this is somewhat difficult to define, we suggest selecting the lower efficacy threshold based on the smallest reduction in efficacy that the FECRT should have sufficient power to detect. Either way, it is important that the lower efficacy threshold be selected before the experiment is planned to ensure that a sufficient sample size is met.</p>
	
	<p>Once the expected efficacy and lower efficacy threshold are specified, it is then possible to determine the classification based either on 90% confidence intervals produced by a valid statistical method, or on the result of separate one-sided statistical tests for efficacy and resistance. Note that the use of 90% confidence intervals is advised because this leads to an overall type I error rate of no more than 5% for any given value of true efficacy. Due to differences in statistical methodology underling different ways of calculating confidence intervals, the precise numbers may differ between methods - however if the classification remains the same the overall result can be considered to be trustworthy. The online calculator for data analysis given above performs these calculations for a dataset provided by the user, and is pre-loaded with advised values for expected efficacy and lower efficacy threshold for common applications.</p>
		
	<h2>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION</h2>

	<p>As with any prospective study, it is important that a proposed FECRT has a sample size that is likely to yield a conclusive result. This means that sample size calculations should be done to determine the necessary sample size before the study is undertaken. The online calculator for prospective sample size calculation above allows this to be done for any proposed FECRT as long as estimates for the required parameters are available for the host and parasite species in question. The calculator is pre-loaded with advised values for pre-treatment variability, post-treatment variability, within-animal correlation for common applications. The method is based on a Monte Carlo approximation of the statistical power associated with the tests for susceptibility and resistance based on sample sizes varying within the range specified by the user.</p>

	<h2>UNDERLYING SOFTWARE</h2>

	<p>For the R and C++ code that underlies the methods presented, see the <a href="https://github.com/ku-awdc/bayescount">GitHub repository for the bayescount package for R</a>.  Pre-compiled versions of the R package can also be installed from our Drat repository using the following R code:</p>
	<p>install.packages('bayescount', dependencies=TRUE, repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com/", kuawdc="https://ku-awdc.github.io/drat/"))</p>
	<p>If running the R package locally then a good place to start from is the vignette:</p>
	<p>vignette("bayescount", package="bayescount")</p>
	<p>Note that the online calculators can also be run directly from R:</p>
	<p>bayescount::launch_shiny("data_analysis")</p>

	<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
	
	<p>This website is currently being developed, and all feedback and criticism are very welcome (<a href="about">contact details</a>).  I am particularly interested in datasets for which the analysis method gives implausible results, any errors obtained from the online tools, and enquries about collaboration regarding analysis of more compelx datasets.  I am also happy to let you know when the website is updated if you send me a request to do so!</p>
