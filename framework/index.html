	<h1>A hypothesis testing framework for the ratio of means of two negative binomial distributions</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center">Page last updated by Matthew Denwood on 16th October 2019</p>
	
	<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
	
	<p>This website accompanies the article "A hypothesis testing framework for the ratio of means of two negative binomial distributions: classifying the efficacy of anthelmintic treatment against intestinal parasites" by Denwood et al. that is currently under peer review.  A pre-peer-reviewed version of the article is available to download from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06667">the arXiv database</a> and can be cited as:</p>
		
	<p>M.J. Denwood, G.T. Innocent, J.C. Prentice, L. Matthews, S.W.J. Reid, C.B. Pipper, B. Levecke, R.M. Kaplan, A.C. Kotze, J. Keiser, M. Palmeirim, and I.J. McKendrick (2019). A hypothesis testing framework for the ratio of means of two negative binomial distributions: classifying the efficacy of anthelmintic treatment against intestinal parasites.  arXiv:1910.06667 [stat.ME].  Retrieved on 2019-10-16, from the arXiv database:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06667
		
	<p>For the R and C++ code that underlies the methods presented, see the <a href="https://github.com/ku-awdc/bayescount">GitHub repository for the bayescount package for R</a>.  The development version of the R package can also be installed (without the need for C++ compilers) from our Drat repository using the following R code:</p>
	<p>install.packages('bayescount', dependencies=TRUE, repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com/", kuawdc="https://ku-awdc.github.io/drat/"))</p>
	<p>If running the R package locally then a good place to start from is the vignette:</p>
	<p>vignette("bayescount", package="bayescount")</p>
	
	<h2>DATA ANALYSIS</h2>

	<p>An interactive application is provided for analysis of an existing dataset using the five methods presented in the article.  The output is presented in terms of the 95% confidence intervals or p-values produced by each method, along with the relevant typology and resulting classification according to our framework.  In the future this application will be extended to provide a validation of the type I and type II error rates associated with each of the analysis methods using parameter values estimated from your data.  To launch the application from within R on your computer use:</p>
	<p>bayescount::launch_shiny("data_analysis")</p>
	<p>Alternatively, the same interactive application <a href="https://ucphepi.shinyapps.io/data_analysis/">can be run from a remote server here</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>TYPOLOGIES</h2>

	<p>This tool allows the user to explore the consequences of using different interpretative frameworks along with the five methods presented in the article in terms of the classification probabilities associated with a dataset simulated with given population parameters.  To launch the application from within R on your computer use:</p>
	<p>bayescount::launch_shiny("typologies")</p>
	<p>Alternatively, the same interactive application <a href="https://ucphepi.shinyapps.io/typologies/">can be run from a remote server here</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>STUDY PLANNING</h2>

	<p>An interactive application is provided for planning a study based on parameter values provided by the user.  The output is presented in terms of the relative frequency of each typology and resulting classification given a specified sample size.  The primary purpose of this tool is to estimate the necessary sample size for a new study, but the type I and type II error rates are also provided for comparison of each of the five methods of analysis presented in the article.  To launch the application from within R on your computer use:</p>
	<p>bayescount::launch_shiny("study_planning")</p>
	<p>Alternatively, the same interactive application <a href="https://ucphepi.shinyapps.io/study_planning/">can be run from a remote server here</a>.</p>

	<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
	
	<p>This website is currently being developed, and all feedback and criticism are very welcome (<a href="about">contact details</a>).  I am particularly interested in datasets for which the analysis method gives implausible results, any errors obtained from the online tools, and enquries about collaboration regarding analysis of more compelx datasets.</p>
	
	<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CITATION</h2>
	
	<p>The work behind these web applications has been (slowly) developed starting with <a href="http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1837/">my PhD at the University of Glasgow</a> and continuing after my move to the <a href="http://ivh.ku.dk/english/employees/?pure=en/persons/487288">University of Copenhagen</a>.  I am grateful to all the coauthors that have contributed to this work, as well as the Universities and funding bodies that have financially supported me over the years.</p>
	<p>As a primarily academic exercise it is very important to be able to demonstrate that this software is being used in order to be able to continue development, so if you use these tools as part of any published work then please ensure to cite the paper given at the top of this page.</p>
